# Fast setup
Download app

Open app
-> Login via spotify (in your browser)

-> Press "Add playlist" button

-> Select playlist

-> Wait couple seconds (loading 100 songs per second)

-> Create keybind (click input -> create keybind -> click anywhere outside input)

Use

## Notes
For now please, don't use something like shift+s for keybind because it will block these keys in your system and you wont be able to type "S". I'll fix it later

Don't run 2 apps at the same time, it will cause some errors.

I won't build app for mac/linux because i can't test it, but you can try.
